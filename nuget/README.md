To build a NuGet package:

# Update the version number in `Bootstrap.Switch.nuspec` 
# On a Windows machine, run `build.cmd`
# Push the generated package to http://nuget.org

> **NOTE** - I'm currently using the date (YYYYMMDD) in the **Patch** portion of the version number because there doesn't seem to be any official version number on the project.
