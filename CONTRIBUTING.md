# Contributing

Prerequisites:

- Node 14 and Yarn 1.22

Flow:

- Fork the repository and checkout `master` branch
- Install or update dependencies running `yarn`
- Build `dist/` and `docs/` directories running `yarn start`
- Change files in `src/` directory
- Do *not* change any files inside `dist/` or `docs/`. These are automatically generated on merge.
- Once finished, submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Bttstrp/bootstrap-switch/compare/master...master). Remember to target `master` as destination branch

Thank you.
